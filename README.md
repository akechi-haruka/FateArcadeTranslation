This is a very hacky partial translation based on FGO mobile strings.
Many texts go out of bounds due to the game being forced full-width, and many other strings are missing since they don't exist in the mobile game.

This contains partial translations for:

* Servants
* Buffs/Debuffs
* NP names / descriptions
* Skill names / descriptions

This contains full translations for:

* Game tutorial (version 11.00)

Translations for items, servant and craft essence flavour texts are server sided.
